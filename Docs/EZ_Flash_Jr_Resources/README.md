## 🎯 What It Does
- A **patched kernel (v1.04e)** for EZ‑Flash Jr that **enables Super Game Boy (SGB) support**.
- Fixes the issue where SGB couldn’t detect the EZ‑Flash Jr cart (resulting in a black screen).
- Fully restores **borders, color palettes, and enhanced SGB sound**.

---

## 🔧 How It Works
- The default EZ‑Flash Jr briefly resets the Game Boy CPU during boot.
- This patch replays the **necessary boot ROM calls** so the SNES correctly detects the cartridge.
- **No hardware mod required** – just replace `ezgb.dat`.

---

## ✅ Compatibility
- Works on:
  - **Super Game Boy 1 (SGB1)**
  - **Super Game Boy 2 (SGB2)**
  - **PAL/NTSC SNES systems**
  - **Some SNES clones**
- Also runs on **DMG/GBC**, though:
  - Increases boot time (due to SGB check).
  - Easily revert to stock kernel if undesired.

---

## 📦 Installation Instructions
1. **Backup** your current `ezgb.dat` file.
2. Download and extract the patched file: `kernel104-sgbenabler.zip`.
3. Place the new `ezgb.dat` on your SD card root.
4. Insert the EZ-Flash Jr into your SGB/SNES.
5. Power on — no reset needed!

---

## 📝 Notes & Feedback
- **Safe and reversible** – does not modify firmware.
- **Minor visual glitches** reported by a few users (resolved with reset).
- Great compatibility across SGB models and SNES regions.
- **Increased boot time** on non-SGB systems is the only drawback.
