## Format the microSD Card

| Format | Card Size         | Recommended? | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|-------|
| FAT32  | 4–32 GB            | Yes          | Native support; stable |
| FAT32  | 64–128 GB          | Yes          | Use [GUIFormat](https://guiformat.com/) to format |
| exFAT  | 64–256 GB+         | Risky        | May cause save errors; not officially supported |
| NTFS   | Any                | No           | Not recognized by EZ-Flash |

## Installing Firmware & Game Files

1. Download the latest kernel from [ezflash.cn](https://www.ezflash.cn/download).
2. Extract the `.zip` using [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org) or WinRAR.
3. Copy these to the root of the microSD card:
   - `ezkernelnew.bin` (Omega DE) or `ezkernel.bin` (Classic Omega)
   - `/CHEAT/` folder (optional)
   - `/IMGS/` thumbnails (optional)
4. Add your ROMs to folders like:
   - `/GBA/` – for GBA ROMs
   - `/GB/` and `/GBC/` – for GB/GBC games
   - `/NES/` – for NES ROMs

## Updating Firmware

1. Insert the microSD card into your EZ-Flash cart.
2. Insert the cart into your handheld.
3. Hold the RIGHT shoulder button (R) while powering on.
4. The update runs automatically if needed.

Do not power off during kernel updates. Plug into a charger for safety.

## Install a Theme (Optional)

1. Create `/THEMES/` on the microSD card.
2. Drop in any `.skn` file or a theme folder.
3. On boot, hold SELECT → go to Theme → choose your theme.

You can also rename a `.skn` to `default.skn` to auto-load it.

- Then remove the SD card and manage `.sav` files on PC
