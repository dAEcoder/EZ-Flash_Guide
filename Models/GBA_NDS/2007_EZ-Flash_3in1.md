## Software Tools

- GBA ExpLoader (by Rudolph)  
  - Used to manage GBA game flashing, rumble control, and RAM activation  
- Patch games with SRAM/EEPROM compatibility if needed  

---

## Save System

- Battery-backed SRAM for save storage  
- Save must be manually written back to microSD via software (e.g. ExpLoader)  
- Save files stored by Slot-1 cart on SD card, not onboard  

---

## Usage Tips

- Use PSRAM for fast loading (up to ~16MB)  
- Use NOR for larger or persistent GBA games (up to 32MB on 3-in-1 Plus)  
- Use Slot-1 cart + GBA ExpLoader for best control  
- Compatible with emulators (i.e., DS homebrew like SNEmulDS) for RAM features  

---

## Limitations

- Not compatible with DSi or 3DS (no Slot-2)  
- Battery may degrade over time (saves will be lost if not replaced)  
- No menu/GUI — controlled entirely through Slot-1 tools  

---

## Notes

- Excellent companion to Slot-1 DS flashcarts that lack GBA support  
- Still favored by some retro DS users for lightweight setups
